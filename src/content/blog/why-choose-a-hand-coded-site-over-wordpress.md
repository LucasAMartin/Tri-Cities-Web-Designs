**Speed and Performance: The Crucial Aspect of User Retention**

When it comes to successful website development, speed is essential. It’s not just a convenience, but the very foundation of user engagement and digital success. The difference between a website that loads instantly and one that takes a few extra seconds can determine whether visitors stay or leave. This is why it’s important to compare the performance differences of hand-coded websites with page builder like WordPress, Wix, and Webflow.

Hand-coded websites have a clear advantage when it comes to loading speed. Their lightweight code and lack of resource-intensive plugins allow them to load up to 10 times faster than WordPress sites. This fast-loading time not only captures visitors’ attention but also reinforces the credibility and professionalism of your digital presence. Speed is more than just a convenience; it’s closely linked to user behavior and conversions. Studies show that if a website takes longer than 3 seconds to load, most users will leave and look for faster alternatives. Hand-coded websites achieve fast loading times by avoiding heavy plugins and prioritizing essential elements.

WordPress sites, while user-friendly, often use feature-rich plugins that can slow down loading times. This trade-off between functionality and speed can result in a compromised user experience. The speed of your website is crucial for user engagement, retention, and conversion rates. Hand-coded websites offer a fast-loading solution that can help capture and retain visitors’ attention, setting the stage for meaningful interactions and sustained success.

**Mobile Optimization and SEO: Unveiling the Mobile-First Advantage**

Mobile optimization is essential for user experience and search engine visibility. Hand-coded websites have an advantage over WordPress sites in this area because they are designed with a mobile-first approach. This means that the website is built with mobile screens as the primary focus, ensuring a responsive and intuitive experience across devices. WordPress sites, on the other hand, can struggle to achieve the same level of mobile optimization. The complexity introduced by the many plugins and themes can hinder the adaptation required for a smooth mobile experience. This can result in a disjointed user journey and negatively impact your SEO efforts.

Search engines, like Google, prioritize mobile-friendly websites. Google uses mobile-first indexing, meaning it primarily uses the mobile version of a site’s content to rank pages. Hand-coded websites, designed with mobile screens as the starting point, align well with this approach and can improve your search engine rankings. A mobile-first design also streamlines the user experience. Hand-coded sites don’t need resource-intensive plugins to achieve mobile responsiveness. Every element adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, providing a frustration-free experience for users on smaller devices. As more users turn to mobile devices, providing an exceptional mobile experience can help capture their attention and convert them into loyal customers.

**Why pay for a website when you can create one yourself using platforms like Wix or WordPress?**

While it may seem like a cost-effective solution, there are several advantages to hiring a developer to build a static website for your business. A static website built by a professional developer can offer many benefits, including faster page speed, quicker loading times, better security, and improved customer conversion rates. It can also help improve your Google rankings. Think of it like painting your house: anyone can buy paint and do it themselves, but the results may not be as good as if a professional did the job. Similarly, web development is a trade that requires skill and expertise. Investing in a professionally built static site can pay off in the long run. A well-designed and well-performing website can help convert visitors into customers and give you an edge over your competition.

It’s important to note that not all WordPress websites or developers are bad. In fact, some developers create excellent custom WordPress sites. WordPress is a great option for websites that require a database and dynamic content generation, such as online stores, blogs, custom applications, or data manipulation. However, for strictly informational websites, a static site is often the better choice. When choosing a developer or agency to build your website, it’s important to do your research and find someone who cares about their work and offers support after the site is built. Investing in your website is an investment in your business, and the return can be well worth the cost.

In my experience, there are two types of people when it comes to business: those who see a website as an expense, and those who see it as an investment. The latter group, often entrepreneurs, understand that spending money on a website is an investment in their business, not just an expense. They can justify the cost by considering the potential return on investment. For example, imagine you hire a developer to create a static website for your business for $3000. While this may seem like a large sum, the benefits of having a professionally designed and well-performing website can far outweigh the cost. A better-looking and faster-loading site can help convert visitors into customers, potentially bringing in an extra $10,000 or more per year in new business.

I offer websites for $150 per month, which may seem like a lot to some people. However, when you consider the value that a well-designed static site can bring to your business, the cost is more than justified. For instance, if my site brings in just one extra client per month for a painter, that’s a return of $650. And with each new customer, the value of my site increases. Plus, for that $150 per month, you have someone on call everyday to handle your website, make updates, and answer any questions you may have. It’s important to remember that when it comes to websites, you get what you pay for. A cheap website from Craigslist or Fiverr may look generic or outdated and may not perform as well as a professionally built site. Just like finding a good tattoo artist, it’s important to do your research and find a reputable developer who can create a high-quality product.

In short, while there are many cheap and quick options available for building a website, it’s important to remember that quality comes at a price. Investing in a well-designed and well-performing website is an investment in your business and can pay off in the long run.

Ultimately, the decision to choose a static or dynamic website depends on your budget and priorities. If you have a limited budget and just need a basic online presence, using WordPress or Wix may be a good option. However, if you have the resources to invest in a more advanced website that can maximize your online presence, a static site built by a developer may be the best choice. If you need a website with a database or the ability to edit your own content, WordPress and other page builders are also good options.

With my business model, you don’t have to choose between doing it yourself to save money or paying a high price for a developer. Instead of charging $3000+ for my work, I offer it for $0 down and $150 per month, making it more accessible to small businesses who need it most. And if you end up not liking my product at the end of our agreement, you can go elsewhere with no strings attached! That being said, I believe once you see how your website ranks and converts customers, you'll have no reason to. A website is an incredible tool when done right, and as a student with no operating costs or employees, I can afford to offer my services at this low price. My goal is to build a website that lasts for years and helps grow your business, and I’ll be there every step of the way.
