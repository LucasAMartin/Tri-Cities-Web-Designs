In today's fast-paced digital landscape, the speed at which your website loads can make or break user engagement. Website visitors demand instant gratification, and if your site takes too long to load, they're likely to bounce off and explore alternatives. Google realizes this, and biases their search results towards better performing websites. This is where optimizing your website for page speed becomes crucial. Not only does it enhance user experience, but it also plays a significant role in search engine rankings. In this article, we'll give a brief overview of the different techniques we can employ to improve website speed.

**Why Page Speed Matters**

Before we delve into the strategies, let's understand why page speed matters so much:

1. **User Experience:** Visitors expect websites to load within a few seconds. A slow-loading site frustrates users, leading to higher bounce rates and decreased engagement.
2. **SEO Impact:** Search engines like Google consider page speed as a ranking factor, especially with Google's introduction of Core Vitals metrics as a major ranking factor. These metrics emphasize the importance of delivering fast and seamless mobile experiences for websites.
3. **Conversion Rates:** Improved user experience resulting from faster load times can lead to higher conversion rates. Whether it's making a purchase, signing up for a newsletter, or any other desired action, users are more likely to follow through on a fast-loading site.
4. **Mobile Performance:** With the increase in mobile browsing, page speed has become even more critical. Slow-loading websites can be especially frustrating on mobile devices with slower connections.

Now that we understand the significance of optimizing page speed, let's explore some effective strategies.

**Getting the Most out of Your Assets**

A crucial part of this optimization process revolves around fine-tuning your website's assets. One key principle is to ensure that images are sized appropriately for their display. Avoid the common mistake of using CSS to resize a large image to a smaller dimension on the screen. This wastes space and slows things down. Additionally, it's essential to compress all your assets. You can do either lossy or lossless, however lossy may lose some image quality so it’s up to you whether that is worth the storage savings. Personally, I am a fan of tinyPNG, however any compression website would likely work the same.

Background images are another key consideration. It's counterproductive to load a massive 2300px wide stock photo on a small 400px wide phone screen. The solution is simple: resize the image to fit the screen and apply compression. This can lead to an incredible reduction in size and faster loading times. For larger screens like tablets and desktops, you can switch back to the original high-resolution image. This approach ensures that you're not just compressing images but also using appropriately sized versions for different devices.

Don't forget the "srcset" attribute, which plays a crucial role in selecting the right image size for different screen dimensions. This attribute allows you to specify a range of images to load based on screen size, with a default "src" image as a fallback. This strategy optimizes load times while maintaining image quality.

Another important aspect is to include height and width attributes for images. Google prefers these attributes, as they help allocate space for images before they load, preventing layout shifts.

**Lazy Loading for Improved Performance**

Lazy loading, achieved through the "loading=“lazy”" attribute, is a powerful technique to improve page loading times. This feature is supported by most modern browsers and enables images to load only when they come into the user's view. However, it's essential to avoid lazy loading images that are immediately visible when the page loads, as this can lead to unexpected layout shifts. Images that are above the fold and visible right away should load conventionally.

**Choosing SVGs Over PNGs**

Opt for SVGs whenever possible, as they offer better performance compared to PNGs. SVGs are lightweight and load faster, contributing to improved user experiences. Platforms like Flaticon provide a plethora of customizable SVG graphics and icons, eliminating the need for external resources like Font Awesome. SVG icons can be easily customized and loaded directly into your website.

For logos and other graphics, consider hiring an SVG graphic illustrator from platforms like Fiverr. Converting logos to SVG format can lead to substantial reductions in file size while retaining visual quality. This investment not only optimizes web performance but also offers versatile branding options for your clients.

**Trimming Unnecessary CDN Links**

It's high time to reevaluate the usage of certain elements. jQuery, for instance, has seen its heyday, and its utility has dwindled over time. Most of its functions can be accomplished using native JavaScript, eliminating the need for this bloated library. It's recommended to move away from jQuery, especially considering that Google's page speed scores highlight its removal as a way to enhance performance.

Similar scrutiny should be applied to Google Fonts and other nonessential CDN links. For custom fonts, consider downloading and hosting them locally using the "@font-face" declaration. This approach minimizes render-blocking resources and contributes to a swifter load time.

**Modernizing JavaScript Loading**

Revamp your approach to JavaScript loading by adding the "defer" attribute to your script tags. This modification ensures that scripts are loaded after the main HTML and CSS, preventing them from blocking the rendering process. JavaScript scripts are now more patient, allowing other essential resources to load smoothly.

**Evaluating with Google Lighthouse**

Once the optimization journey is complete, it's essential to evaluate your efforts using tools like Google Lighthouse. This tool provides valuable insights into aspects like accessibility and overall performance. Achieving a page speed score of 95 or higher, along with impressive Lighthouse scores, signifies a successful optimization process.

These strategies form the cornerstone of my post-website development routine. Here at Tri-Cities Web Development, we use all of these techniques to ensure we do all that we can for website performance. Anyway, I hope this guide proves valuable in your pursuit of creating lightning-fast, well-optimized websites.
